## 🧭 Supported Workflow

We support the **full product development lifecycle**, organized into three phases:

> **📋 Product Ideation → 🛠 Development → ✅ Quality**

### Phase 1: 📋 Product Ideation – Requirements & Planning

- Converts raw inputs (workshop transcripts, Figma designs, documents) into structured, actionable work items.
- Builds context around tasks using Jira, Figma, and other integrated tools.
- Identifies missing information, risks, and open questions.
- Produces Jira-ready epics and stories with a two-gate review process.

### Phase 2: 🛠 Development – Architecture & Implementation

- Translates tasks into structured implementation plans with phases and technical constraints.
- Writes or modifies code with a focus on safety and clarity.
- Keeps changes scoped to the task, respecting existing architecture.
- For UI tasks: uses iterative Figma verification to match designs.

**Two tracks are available:**

| | **Standard Flow** | **UI Flow** (with Figma) |
|---|---|---|
| Plan | `/plan` – architecture & steps | `/plan` – component breakdown with Figma refs |
| Implement | `/implement` – backend & frontend code | `/implement-ui` – UI code + iterative Figma verification |

### Phase 3: ✅ Quality – Review & Testing

- Performs structured code review against acceptance criteria, security, and reliability.
- Verifies UI implementation against Figma designs (single-pass or in loop).
- Creates comprehensive end-to-end tests using Playwright.
- Runs codebase-wide quality analysis (dead code, duplications, improvements).

### Example: Full Lifecycle (Standard Flow)

```text
📋 PRODUCT IDEATION
1️⃣ /analyze-materials <transcript + workshop materials>
   ↳ 📖 Review cleaned transcript, extracted tasks, Jira-formatted output
   ↳ ✅ Approve at each gate before proceeding

🛠 DEVELOPMENT
2️⃣ /research <JIRA_ID or task description>
   ↳ 📖 Review the generated research document
   ↳ ✅ Verify accuracy, iterate if needed

3️⃣ /plan     <JIRA_ID or task description>
   ↳ 📖 Review the implementation plan
   ↳ ✅ Confirm scope, phases, and acceptance criteria

4️⃣ /implement <JIRA_ID or task description>
   ↳ 📖 Review code changes after each phase
   ↳ ✅ Test functionality, verify against plan

✅ QUALITY
5️⃣ /review   <JIRA_ID or task description>
   ↳ 📖 Review findings and recommendations
   ↳ ✅ Address blockers before merging

6️⃣ /implement-e2e <JIRA_ID or task description>
   ↳ 📖 Review generated Page Objects, test files, and fixtures
   ↳ ✅ Run tests locally, verify they pass
```

### Example: Full Lifecycle (UI Flow with Figma)

```text
📋 PRODUCT IDEATION
1️⃣ /analyze-materials <transcript + workshop materials>
   ↳ 📖 Review cleaned transcript, extracted tasks, Jira-formatted output
   ↳ ✅ Approve at each gate before proceeding

🛠 DEVELOPMENT
2️⃣ /research <JIRA_ID or task description>
   ↳ 📖 Review research doc – verify Figma links, requirements
   ↳ ✅ Iterate until context is complete and accurate

3️⃣ /plan         <JIRA_ID or task description>
   ↳ 📖 Review plan – check component breakdown, design references
   ↳ ✅ Confirm phases align with Figma structure

4️⃣ /implement-ui <JIRA_ID or task description>
   ↳ 📖 Review code changes and UI Verification Summary
   ↳ ✅ Manually verify critical UI elements in browser
   ↳ 🔄 Agent calls /review-ui in a loop until PASS or escalation

✅ QUALITY
5️⃣ /review       <JIRA_ID or task description>
   ↳ 📖 Review findings – code quality, a11y, performance
   ↳ ✅ Address all blockers before merging

6️⃣ /implement-e2e <JIRA_ID or task description>
   ↳ 📖 Review generated tests for the UI feature
   ↳ ✅ Run tests locally, verify they pass
```

You can run any flow with either a **Jira ticket ID** or a **free-form task description**.

> ⚠️ **Important:** Each step requires your review and verification. Open the generated documents, go through them carefully, and iterate as many times as needed until the output looks correct. AI assistance does not replace human judgment – treat each output as a draft that needs your approval before proceeding.

### How the UI Verification Loop Works

1. `/implement-ui` implements a UI component
2. Calls `/review-ui` to perform **single-pass verification** (read-only)
3. `/review-ui` uses **Figma MCP** (EXPECTED) + **Playwright MCP** (ACTUAL) → returns PASS or FAIL with diff table
4. If FAIL → `/implement-ui` fixes the code and calls `/review-ui` again
5. Repeats until PASS or max 5 iterations (then escalates)

### Example: Standalone Product Ideation

For converting discovery workshop recordings into Jira-ready tasks without continuing to development:

```text
📋 PRODUCT IDEATION
1️⃣ /analyze-materials <transcript + workshop materials>
   ↳ 📖 Review cleaned transcript – verify topics, decisions, action items
   ↳ ✅ Confirm nothing important was removed during cleaning

   ↳ 📖 Review extracted epics and user stories
   ↳ ✅ Verify scope, dependencies, and acceptance criteria (Gate 1)

   ↳ 📖 Review Jira-formatted tasks before push
   ↳ ✅ Approve creation of Jira issues (Gate 2)
```

> ⚠️ **Important:** The business analyst produces three artifacts in sequence: cleaned transcript, extracted tasks, and Jira-formatted tasks. Each artifact has a mandatory review gate – you must approve the output before the agent proceeds to the next step.

## 🔌 MCP Server Configuration

To unlock the full workflow (Jira, Figma, code search, browser automation), you need to configure the MCP servers. We provide a ready-to-use template in [`.vscode/mcp.json`](./.vscode/mcp.json).

You have two options for installation:

### Option 1: User Profile (Recommended)

This is the best option as it enables these tools globally across all your projects.

1. Open the **Command Palette**: `CMD` + `Shift` + `P`.
2. Type and select **“MCP: Open User Configuration”**.
3. This will open your global `mcp.json` file.
4. Copy the contents of [`.vscode/mcp.json`](./.vscode/mcp.json) from this repository and paste them into your user configuration file.

### Option 2: Workspace Configuration

Use this if you want to enable these tools only for a specific project.

1. Copy the `.vscode/mcp.json` file from this repository.
2. Paste it into the `.vscode` folder of your target project (e.g., `my-project/.vscode/mcp.json`).

### Official Documentation

To learn more about configuring these servers, check their official documentation:

- [Atlassian MCP](https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-rovo-mcp-server/docs/getting-started-with-the-atlassian-remote-mcp-server/)
- [Context7 MCP](https://github.com/upstash/context7)
- [Playwright MCP](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp)
- [Figma MCP](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/32132100833559-Guide-to-the-Figma-MCP-server)
- [Sequential Thinking MCP](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/sequentialthinking)

### Configuring Context7 API Key

To get higher rate limits and access to private repositories, you can provide a Context7 API key.
You can get your key at [context7.com/dashboard](https://context7.com/dashboard).

We use VS Code's `inputs` feature to securely prompt for the API key. When you first use the Context7 MCP, VS Code will ask for the key and store it securely.

To enable this, modify your `mcp.json` configuration (User or Workspace) to use the `--api-key` CLI argument with an input variable:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "context7": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@upstash/context7-mcp@latest",
        "--api-key",
        "${input:context7-api-key}"
      ]
    }
  },
  "inputs": [
    {
      "id": "context7-api-key",
      "description": "Context7 API Key (optional, for higher rate limits)",
      "type": "promptString",
      "password": true
    }
  ]
}
```

> **Note:** Server IDs in `mcp.json` are lowercase (e.g., `context7`, `figma-mcp-server`). If you copied an older template with different names, update your configuration to match the current template.

### What each MCP is used for

- 🧩 **Atlassian MCP** – access Jira issues for `/research`, `/plan`, `/implement`, `/review`.
- 🎨 **Figma MCP Server** – pull design details, components, and variables for design‑driven work.
- 📚 **Context7 MCP** – semantic search in external docs and knowledge bases.
- 🧪 **Playwright MCP** – run browser interactions and end‑to‑end style checks from Copilot.
- 🧠 **Sequential Thinking MCP** – advanced reasoning tool for complex problem analysis.

> Some MCPs require **API keys or local apps running**. Configure auth as described in each MCP's own documentation.

### 🧠 Sequential Thinking MCP

We use the **Sequential Thinking MCP** to handle complex logic, reduce hallucinations, and ensure thorough problem analysis. It allows agents to:

- **Revise** previous thoughts when new information is found.
- **Branch** into alternative lines of thinking.
- **Track** progress through a complex task.
