# KPIs & Metrics

:::tip Validated Benchmarks
Our AI-Driven Development Framework has been validated across **50+ AI-powered projects** at The Software House, delivering **30% faster delivery** and **200%+ AI usage growth** across engineering teams. The metrics below reflect the expected impact based on this real-world adoption.
:::

Track these metrics to measure the impact of adopting Copilot Collections in your team.

## Development Velocity

| KPI | Metric | Expected Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **Context gathering time** | Time from task assignment to starting implementation | Reduce by 60–80% |
| **Planning time** | Time to produce an implementation plan | Reduce by 50–70% |
| **Implementation speed** | Features delivered per sprint | Increase by 30–50% |
| **Onboarding time** | Time for new developer to deliver first meaningful PR | Reduce by 40–60% |
| **Rework cycles** | Number of times code is sent back after review | Reduce by 40–60% |

**How:** Automated research replaces manual Jira/Figma/codebase exploration. Structured plan generation with gap analysis eliminates ambiguity. Clear plans and automated patterns accelerate implementation.

## Bug Reduction

| KPI | Metric | Expected Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **UI defects found in QA** | Design mismatches caught post-merge | Reduce by 70–90% |
| **E2E test flakiness** | Percentage of flaky E2E tests | Reduce by 50–80% |
| **Regression bugs** | Bugs introduced by new code in existing features | Reduce by 30–50% |
| **Security vulnerabilities** | Critical/high severity issues found in scans | Reduce by 30–50% |
| **Database performance issues** | Slow queries, missing indexes, N+1 problems | Reduce by 40–60% |

**How:** Automated Figma verification loop catches pixel-level issues. Enforced Page Object patterns and auto-waiting reduce flakiness. Implementation gap analysis prevents accidental changes. Every code review includes security checks. SQL skill enforces `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` and indexing.

## Code Quality

| KPI | Metric | Expected Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **Dead code percentage** | Unused imports, functions, files in the codebase | Reduce by 50–70% |
| **Code duplication** | Percentage of duplicated logic across files | Reduce by 40–60% |
| **Test coverage** | Percentage of critical paths covered by tests | Increase by 20–40% |
| **Consistency score** | Adherence to project coding standards | Increase by 50–70% |
| **Review cycle time** | Time from PR open to approval | Reduce by 30–50% |

**How:** Automated dead code detection via `/code-quality-check`. Duplication detection and consolidation recommendations. Every plan includes test requirements. Technical context discovery enforces project conventions. Automated first-pass review with structured findings.

## Figma Design Matching

| KPI | Metric | Expected Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **Design-to-code accuracy** | UI components matching Figma within tolerance | Increase to 95–99% |
| **Figma verification iterations** | Average fix-verify cycles per component | Target: ≤ 2 iterations |
| **Design QA feedback rounds** | Design review rounds before sign-off | Reduce by 60–80% |
| **Accessibility compliance** | Components passing a11y checks | Increase by 30–50% |

**How:** Automated verification with exact pixel comparison. Structured diff reports with recommended fixes. Issues caught before human design review. Frontend implementation skill enforces semantic HTML and ARIA patterns.
