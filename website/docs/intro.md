# Introduction

**Copilot Collections** is an AI-powered product engineering framework that helps teams build wonderful products — covering the full lifecycle from product ideation through development to quality assurance.

Built by [The Software House](https://tsh.io) and validated across 50+ AI-powered projects.

## The Problem

According to Gartner, only **10% of software engineers** see meaningful productivity improvement from AI tools. The gap isn't the technology — it's the lack of structure, specialization, and repeatable workflows around it.

Most teams use AI for code completion. **Copilot Collections turns AI into an end-to-end product engineering partner** — from converting a workshop transcript into a Jira backlog, through architecture design and implementation, to automated code review and E2E testing.

## What It Provides

| 🧠 **Structured Workflows** | 5 | Standard Flow, UI Flow, E2E Testing Flow, Workshop Analysis Flow, Copilot Customization Flow |

## Key Benefits

### For Product Teams
- **Workshop to backlog in minutes** — Process transcripts, Figma designs, and documents into structured epics and stories with a quality review gate. Push to Jira or Shortcut. No more lost workshop outputs.
- **Systematic backlog quality** — 10-pass quality analysis catches missing entity lifecycles, error states, notification gaps, and undocumented dependencies in both new and existing backlogs.

### For Developers
- **Instant task context** — Pull requirements from Jira, designs from Figma, and patterns from the codebase into one research document. No more tool-hopping.
- **Structured implementation plans** — Get phased plans with CREATE/MODIFY/REUSE labels, security considerations, and definitions of done before writing a single line of code.
- **Pixel-perfect UI delivery** — Automated Figma verification loop catches design mismatches before human review. Design-to-code accuracy reaches 95–99%.

### For Engineering Leads
- **Consistent quality gates** — Every task goes through the same structured review process regardless of who implements it.
- **Faster onboarding** — New developers get structured context and clear plans within minutes instead of days.
- **Measurable impact** — 30% faster delivery, 60–80% reduction in context-gathering time, 70–90% fewer UI defects reaching QA.

## Quick Wins — Solve Real Problems Today

| Problem | Solution | Time |
|---|---|---|
| Workshop notes sitting in notebooks | `/tsh-analyze-materials` — epics and stories in your task management tool | ~15 min |
| New task with vague requirements | `/tsh-implement PROJ-123` — automatic research, planning, and implementation | ~20 min |
| UI doesn't match Figma | `/tsh-implement` — automated Figma verification loop via internal UI prompt | ~20 min |
| Inconsistent code reviews | `/tsh-review PROJ-123` — structured multi-dimensional review | ~5 min |
| Flaky or missing E2E tests | `/tsh-implement` — Engineering Manager delegates to E2E Engineer | ~10 min |
| Technical debt piling up | `/tsh-review-codebase` — full quality analysis with action plan | ~15 min |
| Cloud costs out of control | `/tsh-analyze-aws-costs` or `/tsh-analyze-gcp-costs` — cost optimization audit | ~10 min |
| Infrastructure security gaps | `/tsh-audit-infrastructure` — security and best practices audit | ~15 min |

## How It Works

Every task follows a structured lifecycle:

> **Ideate → Implement → Review**

1. **Ideate** — Convert workshop materials into structured epics and stories for your task management tool.
2. **Implement** — A single `/tsh-implement` command triggers three internal phases: **Research** (gather context from Jira/Shortcut, Figma, and the codebase), **Plan** (create a step-by-step architecture plan), and **Build** (execute the plan with scoped, reviewable changes).
3. **Review** — Verify against acceptance criteria, security, and quality standards.

Each phase produces a documented artifact that feeds the next, ensuring nothing is lost between steps. Think of it as a **relay race** — every handoff is a reviewed artifact.
