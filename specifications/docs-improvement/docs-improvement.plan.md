# Docs Improvement: Content Enrichment & Frontend Redesign - Implementation Plan

## Task Details

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Jira ID | N/A (prompt-driven task) |
| Title | Improve documentation website with V1 framework content and Algolia DocSearch-inspired frontend |
| Description | Enrich the docs site with validated content from the [V1] TSH AI Development Framework document and redesign the frontend to align with the TSH brand (tsh.io), using Algolia DocSearch as visual inspiration. Targets both engineering leaders (value messaging, stats, philosophy) and developers (reference docs, quick-start). |
| Priority | Medium |
| Related Research | [docs-improvement.research.md](./docs-improvement.research.md) |

## Proposed Solution

The solution delivers two parallel tracks in a single cohesive execution:

**Track A — Frontend Redesign**: Transform the current minimal Docusaurus homepage into a modern, branded experience. Replace the basic blue palette with TSH-aligned dark navy + gradient accents. Redesign the hero with gradient background, stats bar, and prominent CTAs. Replace emoji icons with inline SVG icons in feature cards. Add new homepage sections: a workflow showcase with code examples and a social proof section with philosophy and business stats.

**Track B — Content Enrichment**: Integrate validated, marketing-ready content from the V1 framework document into key docs pages. Add the Core Philosophy narrative to the intro, relay race metaphor to the workflow overview, Gartner business context to the value section, and task labeling details to the standard flow docs.

All changes are CSS + React component modifications and markdown content updates. No new npm dependencies. No backend/API changes. The site remains a fully static Docusaurus 3.7 deployment on Vercel.

## Open Questions

| # | Question | Answer | Status |
|---|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Should the TSH brand colors use exact values from tsh.io or an approximation? | Use TSH-inspired palette that works with Docusaurus theming. Dark navy (#0a1628 / #0f1d33) for hero backgrounds, blue-to-teal gradient accents. Exact hex values can be refined during implementation. | ✅ Resolved |
| 2 | Should new homepage sections have scroll animations? | Defer animations to a future iteration. Focus on layout, content, and branding first. Listed in Improvements. | ✅ Resolved |
| 3 | What stats figures should be used on the hero? | Use V1 document figures: "30% Faster Delivery", "200%+ AI Usage Growth", "50+ AI-Powered Projects". These are validated marketing stats. | ✅ Resolved |

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 2: Feature Cards Redesign

#### Task 2.1 - [MODIFY] Replace emoji icons with inline SVG icons
**Description**: Replace the 6 emoji icons in `website/src/components/HomepageFeatures/index.tsx` with inline SVG React components. Each SVG should be a simple, recognizable icon using `currentColor` or CSS custom properties for theming. Update the `FeatureItem` type to use `React.ReactNode` for the icon field instead of `string`.

Icons to create:
- Shared Workflows → circular arrows / flow diagram
- Specialized Agents → person/group silhouette
- Task Prompts → terminal / command line
- Reusable Skills → cog/wrench/tools
- MCP Integrations → plug / connection
- VS Code Setup → puzzle piece / extension

**Definition of Done**:

- [x] `FeatureItem` type updated to support `React.ReactNode` icon

#### Task 2.2 - [MODIFY] Redesign feature card layout and styling
**Description**: Update the feature card styling in `website/src/components/HomepageFeatures/styles.module.css` and the card markup in `index.tsx`. Cards should have: rounded corners, subtle border, hover lift effect with shadow increase, icon displayed in a rounded background container, consistent padding, and professional spacing. The overall features section should have a subtle background differentiation from the hero.

**Definition of Done**:
- [x] Cards have rounded corners (`border-radius`) and subtle border
- [x] Cards have hover effect (translateY lift + shadow increase)
- [x] Icons displayed in rounded container with background accent

#### Task 2.3 - [MODIFY] Add section title and description to features area
**Description**: Add a centered heading and brief description above the feature cards grid (e.g., "Everything You Need" + "A complete toolkit for AI-assisted development"). This follows the Algolia DocSearch pattern of section introductions.

**Definition of Done**:
- [x] Section heading displayed above feature cards
- [x] Brief description paragraph below heading
- [x] Text is centered and uses appropriate heading hierarchy (h2)
- [x] Styling consistent with overall brand

---

### Phase 3: New Homepage Sections

#### Task 3.1 - [CREATE] Create WorkflowShowcase component
**Description**: Create a new `website/src/components/WorkflowShowcase/` component with `index.tsx` and `styles.module.css`. The component displays the 4-phase workflow in an engaging visual layout. Each phase shows: phase number, name, agent, slash command, and a brief description. Use a horizontal timeline layout on desktop and vertical stack on mobile. Include a styled code block showing example usage.

**Definition of Done**:
- [x] Component created at `website/src/components/WorkflowShowcase/index.tsx`

- [x] Uses CSS modules for all styling (no global CSS leakage)
- [x] Responsive layout: horizontal on desktop, vertical stack on mobile
- [x] Background color alternates from surrounding sections
- [x] Works in both light and dark modes

#### Task 3.2 - [CREATE] Create SocialProof component
**Description**: Create a new `website/src/components/SocialProof/` component with `index.tsx` and `styles.module.css`. The component presents the business case for the framework with: a prominent quote (Core Philosophy from V1), V1 validated stats in a grid (30% Faster Delivery, 200%+ AI Usage Growth, 50+ Projects), and a Gartner context line. Uses a dark background section to create visual contrast.

**Definition of Done**:
- [x] Component created at `website/src/components/SocialProof/index.tsx`
- [x] Styles created at `website/src/components/SocialProof/styles.module.css`
- [x] Displays Core Philosophy quote prominently
- [x] Stats grid shows 3 key metrics from V1 document
- [x] Gartner stat displayed as supporting context
- [x] Dark background section for visual contrast
- [x] Uses CSS modules for all styling
- [x] Responsive: stats grid wraps on mobile
- [x] Works in both light and dark modes

#### Task 3.3 - [MODIFY] Integrate new sections into homepage
**Description**: Update `website/src/pages/index.tsx` to import and render the new WorkflowShowcase and SocialProof components. Section order: Hero → Features → WorkflowShowcase → SocialProof → Footer. Ensure proper component imports and consistent section spacing.

**Definition of Done**:
- [x] WorkflowShowcase imported and rendered after HomepageFeatures
- [x] SocialProof imported and rendered after WorkflowShowcase
- [x] Section order is correct: Hero → Features → Workflow → Social Proof → Footer

---

### Phase 4: Content Enrichment

#### Task 4.1 - [MODIFY] Enrich Introduction page with Core Philosophy
**Description**: Update `website/docs/intro.md` to add an "Our Philosophy" section after the "What It Provides" table. Content sourced from V1 document: the framework as a "virtual delivery team" that handles grunt work (research, planning, review, code quality), the relay race metaphor for phase handoffs, and the differentiation message.

**Definition of Done**:
- [x] New "Our Philosophy" section added to intro.md
- [x] Includes the "virtual delivery team" concept from V1
- [x] Includes the relay race metaphor for workflow handoffs
- [x] Content is accurate (no references to removed features)
- [x] Markdown renders correctly in Docusaurus
- [x] No broken links or formatting issues

#### Task 4.2 - [MODIFY] Enrich Workflow Overview with relay race metaphor
**Description**: Update `website/docs/workflow/overview.md` to add the relay race metaphor as a Docusaurus admonition (tip or info box) near the top of the page. Add a brief explanation of the phase handoff concept — each phase produces a documented artifact (the "baton") that feeds the next.

**Definition of Done**:
- [x] Relay race metaphor added as a Docusaurus admonition box
- [x] Phase handoff concept explained (artifact as baton)
- [x] Content placed logically near the workflow introduction
- [x] No duplication of existing content on the page
- [x] Markdown renders correctly

#### Task 4.3 - [MODIFY] Enrich Value section with business context
**Description**: Update `website/docs/value/use-cases.md` to add a business context introduction at the top referencing the Gartner stat (only 10% of software engineers see meaningful productivity improvement from AI). Position the framework as the solution to this gap. Update `website/docs/value/kpis.md` to add a "Validated Benchmarks" callout with the V1 framework stats (30% faster delivery, 50+ projects, 200%+ growth).

**Definition of Done**:
- [x] Gartner stat added to use-cases.md as business context intro
- [x] V1 benchmarks added to kpis.md as a "Validated Benchmarks" callout
- [x] Stats match the V1 document values exactly
- [x] Content reads naturally within existing page structure
- [x] Markdown renders correctly with no broken formatting

#### Task 4.4 - [MODIFY] Add CREATE/MODIFY/REUSE task labeling to Standard Flow
**Description**: Update `website/docs/workflow/standard-flow.md` to add a section explaining the task labeling system used in implementation plans. Each task in a plan is labeled CREATE (new code), MODIFY (change existing code), or REUSE (use as-is). This helps developers understand the scope and impact of each task at a glance.

**Definition of Done**:
- [x] New section or subsection explaining CREATE/MODIFY/REUSE labels
- [x] Clear definition of each label type with brief examples
- [x] Content placed in a logical location (after the Plan phase or as a callout)
- [x] No duplication of existing content
- [x] Markdown renders correctly

---

### Phase 5: Code Review

#### Task 5.1 - [REUSE] Run automated code review
**Description**: Run the `tsh-code-reviewer` agent against all changes from Phases 1–4. The review should verify: code quality and consistency, accessibility of new SVG icons and components, responsive design correctness, content accuracy (no outdated stats or removed features), proper CSS module scoping, TypeScript type correctness, and build success.

**Definition of Done**:
- [x] Code review executed by `tsh-code-reviewer` agent
- [x] All critical and major findings addressed
- [x] `npm run build` succeeds with final changes
- [x] No TypeScript errors
- [x] No accessibility regressions (SVGs have aria-labels, heading hierarchy correct)
- [x] All content verified against V1 document — no outdated references

## Security Considerations

- **Static site — minimal attack surface**: The docs site is fully static (Docusaurus SSG deployed on Vercel). No user input, no APIs, no authentication, no server-side logic.
- **External links**: All existing external links use `rel="noopener noreferrer"` and `target="_blank"`. New links (if any) must follow the same pattern.
- **Content accuracy**: V1 document contains outdated references (Frontend SE agent, Copilot Spaces, GitHub MCP). These must NOT be propagated to the docs site. Only validated content should be used.
- **No sensitive data**: The stats used (30% faster, 50+ projects) are marketing figures from a public-facing document. No internal metrics or proprietary data is exposed.
- **SVG injection**: Inline SVGs are defined in source code (not user-provided), eliminating XSS risk via SVG.

## Quality Assurance

Acceptance criteria checklist to verify the implementation meets the defined requirements:

- [x] `npm run build` succeeds without errors after all phases
- [x] Homepage renders correctly in light mode with TSH-aligned branding
- [x] Homepage renders correctly in dark mode with appropriate color adjustments
- [x] Hero section displays: gradient background, gradient title text, stats bar, impact stats, dual CTAs
- [x] All 6 feature cards display custom SVG icons (no emoji)
- [x] Feature cards have hover effects and professional card styling
- [x] WorkflowShowcase section displays 4 phases with code example
- [x] SocialProof section displays philosophy quote, 3 stats, Gartner context
- [x] Homepage is responsive at mobile (375px), tablet (768px), and desktop (1280px) breakpoints
- [x] All SVG icons have `role="img"` and `aria-label` attributes
- [x] Heading hierarchy is correct (h1 hero → h2 sections → h3 cards)
- [x] All documentation pages render correctly with new color palette
- [x] Navbar and footer styling are consistent with new palette
- [x] Search functionality remains operational
- [x] intro.md includes "Our Philosophy" section with V1 content
- [x] workflow/overview.md includes relay race metaphor admonition
- [x] value/use-cases.md includes Gartner stat context
- [x] value/kpis.md includes V1 validated benchmarks
- [x] standard-flow.md includes CREATE/MODIFY/REUSE labeling explanation
- [ ] No references to outdated V1 content (Frontend SE agent, Copilot Spaces, GitHub MCP, "7 skills")
- [ ] All content stats match V1 document source exactly

## Improvements (Out of Scope)

Potential improvements identified during planning that are not part of the current task:

- **Scroll animations**: Add CSS/JS fade-in and slide-up animations triggered on scroll. Deferred to avoid complexity in Phase 1.
- **Interactive workflow diagram**: Replace ASCII workflow diagram in docs with an SVG/React interactive diagram with clickable phases.
- **FAQ / Troubleshooting page**: Create a dedicated FAQ page addressing common setup and usage questions.
- **Customization guide**: Document how teams can extend agents, add custom skills, or create new prompts.
- **Contributors page**: Dedicated page listing key contributors from the V1 document with roles and photos.
- **"ADDF" branding**: Consider using "AI-Driven Development Framework" (ADDF) as alternative branding per V1 document.
- **Search UX enhancement**: Add "Press ⌘K to search" keyboard shortcut hint in the navbar.
- **Dark mode glow effects**: Add subtle glow/neon effects on gradient elements in dark mode for extra visual polish.
- **Micro-interactions**: Add hover effects with smooth transitions on nav items, cards, and buttons.
- **Video/GIF demos**: Create short video walkthroughs or animated GIFs showing the workflow in action.

| 2026-02-20 | Phase 5 completed: Code review by tsh-code-reviewer agent — PASS with 3 minor findings, 2 addressed (unused import removed, prefers-reduced-motion added) |

## Code Review Findings

**Verdict: PASS**

**Critical**: None

**Major**: None

**Minor (addressed)**:
- M1: Removed unused `clsx` import from `index.tsx`
- M2: Added `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` media query to `custom.css`

**Minor (deferred to future iteration)**:
- M3: Hardcoded colors in dark-background sections (`#ffffff`, `#cbd5e1`, etc.) — functionally correct since these sections always render on dark gradient backgrounds regardless of theme. Could extract to CSS custom properties for maintainability.

**Suggestions (not actioned — low priority)**:
- S1: Duplicate impact stats data in hero and SocialProof — acceptable since contexts differ
- S2: WorkflowShowcase code example uses `{'\n'}` concatenation — could use `<pre>` with template literal
- S3: SVG icon components could be extracted to shared Icons directory if reuse needed
