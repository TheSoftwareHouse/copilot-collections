<!-- 
  Custom Instruction File
  =======================
  Scoped conventions for files matching the applyTo pattern.
  
  Place this file in: .github/instructions/
  Name convention: {scope}.instructions.md
  
  Guidelines:
  - Each instruction should be a single, clear statement
  - Include reasoning for non-obvious rules ("because...")
  - Show preferred and avoided patterns with code examples
  - Don't duplicate rules from copilot-instructions.md
  - Don't duplicate what linters/formatters already enforce
-->

<!-- Describe the conventions for this file scope -->

<!-- Preferred patterns -->
<!-- Show concrete code examples of the RIGHT way -->

<!-- Avoided patterns -->
<!-- Show concrete code examples of what to AVOID and why -->
