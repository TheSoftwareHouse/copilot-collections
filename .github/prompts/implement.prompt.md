Your goal is to implement the feature according to the provided implementation plan and feature context.
Thoroughly review the implementation plan and feature context before starting the implementation. Ensure a clear understanding of the requirements and technical designs to deliver effective solutions.
Use available tools to gather necessary information and document your findings.

Follow the plan step by step. After completing each task, update the relevant plan to reflect the progress made by checking the box for the completed task.

If you need to make changes to the original solution during implementation, ensure to document those changes in the specified plan file in Changelog section. This helps maintain clarity and ensures that all modifications are tracked.

Follow these steps in your workflow:

1. Review the implementation plan and feature context thoroughly.
2. Start implementing the feature according to the plan.
3. After completing each task, update the relevant plan to reflect the progress made by checking the box for the completed task in the plan document.
4. Document any changes made to the original solution in the specified plan file.
5. Validate your changes against the implementation plan and feature files at the end of your work.

Ensure to write clean, efficient, and maintainable code following best practices and coding standards for the project. Collaborate with other team members, including business analysts, architects, and QA engineers, to ensure successful project outcomes. Make sure to understand instructions provided in \*.instructions.md files related to the feature.

In case of bug fixes makes sure to reproduce the issue, analyze the root cause, and implement a fix that addresses the problem without introducing new issues. Use tests to reproduce and then verify the fix.
